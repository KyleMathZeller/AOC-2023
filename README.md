This is my attempt at the AOC 2023 problems for a chance to learn, grow and have fun. You can observe the code to see what I learned and how 
I developed as a coder. I would like to thank my friends Madeline, Lupa, and Gallus for helping me as well as Hyperneutrio for great insight to 
many of the problems.
